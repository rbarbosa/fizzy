  # Entries read into memory hold one database record each, and the largest
  # column any of them can fill is a rich text body; every other text column the
  # export writes tops out at 64KB. Reading them with no ceiling let a
  # two-megabyte upload inflate to gigabytes inside a jobs worker. Importing a
  # rich text body costs about 35 times its size once the HTML is parsed, so this
  # holds one body to roughly 140MB of memory while still fitting every body real
  # accounts hold today.

  # The extractor is fed compressed bytes, so how much it hands back in one call
  # is the archive author's choice: a maximally compressible slice expands about
  # a thousandfold. Slicing here keeps every real record a single read of the
  # archive, which matters on S3 where each read is its own range request, while
  # capping what one call can return at tens of megabytes.
  EXTRACT_SLICE_SIZE = 64.kilobytes

  # Deflating each entry on its own is what makes an archive's total expansion a
  # usable signal: a real export barely shrinks, since records are small and per
  # entry overhead eats the savings, while a crafted one expands a thousandfold.
  # Budgeting everything read out of an archive against what was actually
  # uploaded bounds the streaming path too, where an entry's own declared size is
  # the archive author's word. The floor keeps a small archive holding one large
  # rich text body importable.
